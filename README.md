# ProceduralDungeons

This program is currently designed to generate a nxm dungeon with randomly generated pathways with a start and a finish. Current plans will keep the design aspect to a minimum, but implement multiple ways to customize the random aspects. 

Currently, the program creates a nxm dungeon, places tile rooms with 2 varying sizes based off entrances, and adds walls with and without entrances. 

Plans:
Add indicator of start and finish
Add landscape/objects in rooms randomly
Add FP Pov player object
